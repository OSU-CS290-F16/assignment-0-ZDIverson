    I thought this assignment went well, it was a good introduction into git and basics of html.
    I didnt really have any challenges when trying to complete with this assignment. I did have some confusion when trying to get into git classroom.
     As well as put the web page on the engineering server. I solved them by Piazza, emailing the professor and using the internet to help me troubleshoot a problem.

     I leanred the basics of HTML, how it is structures. I leanred what is GIT, how to use it, and most importantly why do should I use it.
     I already knew about HTML 5 and Git but hasnt used it a while so it was a nice refresher.
