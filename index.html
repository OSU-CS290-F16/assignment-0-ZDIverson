    <h1>Zachary Iverson</h1>

    <h3>Major: Computer Science</h3>
    <h3>Year: Senior</h3>
    <p> On a scale on 1 to 10, I'd say I'm a 5 when it comes down to how much HTML I know.</p>

    <p> I hope to get familiar with HTML, CSS, and javascript. More specifically how they all work together. </p>

    <p> Yes I have signed up for Piazza. </p>

    <p> The most interesting thing about me is when I was younger I lived in Singapore for 6 years. </p>
